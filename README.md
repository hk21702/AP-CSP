# AP-CSP

project for AP CSP. Not sure if it works anymore. Some files were lost. good enough for the college board I guess. Use this as an example, don't copy paste it. They will be able to tell and you'll be in big trouble.

Windows UWP app thats a crude visual simulation of a basic pendulum with variables that can be changed through a UI.
